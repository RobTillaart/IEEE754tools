# IEEE754_tools

Arduino library to manipulate IEEE754 float numbers fast.

## Description

IEEE754tools.h contains a collection of bit-hacks to speed up a number 
of operations on floating point numbers on the Arduino. These bit-hacks
started in 2010 (oldest code found) or maybe even earlier.

## WARNING
* If you don't need micro-second speedups **do not use** these code snippets.
* code is experimental, so use with care.
* only tested on UNO

## Future

* include https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/IEEE754tools/
* write examples
* test on ESP32
* binary transfer over serial (see playground)

## Operations

See examples
