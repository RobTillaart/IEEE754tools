# IEEE754tools

Arduino library to manipulate IEEE754 float numbers fast.


## Description

IEEE754tools.h contains a collection of experimental bit-hacks to speed up 
a number of operations on floating point numbers on the **Arduino UNO**.
These bit-hacks started in 2010 (oldest code found), maybe even earlier.

## WARNING

- **do not use** this lib for production code unless you verified the correctness.
Code is experimental, so use with care at your own risk.
- If you don't need micro-second speed ups **do not use** these code snippets.
- **do not use for ESP32** ESP32 does things differently ==> not all code works.


## Test results examples 

updated for 0.2.2

| example       |  UNO   |  ESP32  |
|:--------------|:------:|:-------:|
| fastNegate    |   Y    |    Y    |
| float2Double  |   Y    |    N    |
| IEEE754_equal |   Y    |    N    |


ESP32 - needs investigation as UNO verified code fails.
(something for a long winter)


## Operations

See examples


## Future

#### must
- test with double
- test on ESP23

#### should
- investigate other speed ups
- bring more structure in this library.

#### could
- write more examples
  - example binary transfer over Serial
  - example binary transfer over Ethernet
- link to float16 in documentation
